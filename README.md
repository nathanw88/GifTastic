# GifTastic

an app where clicking on of the topic buttons will call giphy api sending 10 gifs for you to view with rating attached,
clicking a button will prepend 10 additional gifs to screen.
with the ability for users to add buttons as they wish.
I did borrow code from previous class activities.
